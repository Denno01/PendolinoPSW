Script for the PendolinoPSW, a SIMPLE and NOT encrypted password manager made with python.
In the dist folder there's the .exe file with logo.png, copy this folder if you're not interested in the script.
The .exe will create in the folder a data.json file where the credentials are stored, if you delete this file all the data will be lost.
